Liquid-vapor phase change is ubiquitous in both natural and engineered devices. It's happening around us - all the time. The cup of coffee, the tree outdoor, the AC unit indoor, they are all undergoing "evaporation" in some form. Curved surfaces (such as droplets and bubbles) exhibit unique properties due to surface tension that alters evaporation. In turn, the evaporation further deforms and moves the interface. At UCLID, we focus on liquid-vapor phase change and associated interfacial dynamics. We study multi-phase transport phenomena using a combination of visualization tools, theory, and modeling. We work on a variety of topics including but not limited to boiling, condensation, dehumidification, evaporative deposition, colloidal self-assembly, porous media transport, electronics cooling, cryogenics, variable-gravity fluid management, and nano-/micro-scale heat transfer.
