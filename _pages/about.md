The UC Lab for Interfacial Dynamics (UCLID) is an interdisciplinary laboratory with both experimental and computational capabilities to explore transport mechanics at curved liquid-vapor surfaces such as drops, bubbles, sprays, etc. The lab is housed in [Mechanical and Materials Engineering](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/mechanical-materials-engineering.html) at [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/) and is led by Prof. Kishan Bellur.

Liquid-vapor interfaces are ubiquitous in both natural and engineered devices. We often dont notice it but they are all around us! The cup of coffee on your desk, the tree outdoor, the AC unit indoor, they all have liquid-vapor interfaces and are undergoing “evaporation” in some form. Curved interfaces (such as droplets and bubbles) are particularly interesting becasue they exhibit unique properties due to surface tension thereby sigificantly altering evaporation dynamics. In turn, the evaporation deforms and moves the interface. This coupling between evaporation and interface dynamics is not well understood. This understanding is critical to develop systems where surface tension becomes the dominant force (such as in the microgravity of space or mirco/nano-scale devices on earth).

At UCLUD, we study phase change at curved surfaces at a fundamental level using **theory**, _on-earth_ and _in-space_ **experiments**, and develop computational tools for **modeling and simulation** of multi-phase phenomena. We then leverage the knowledge gained to pioneer next generation microscale phase change transfer devices (heat pipes, HVAC, electronics cooling), enable new technologies for the upcoming hydrogen economy (storage and transport), develop solutions for thermo-fluid management in microgravity and address critical issues in the food-water-energy nexus (desalination, distillation) and breakthroughs in manufacturing (coating, inkjet printing, additive manufacturing). Liquid-vapor interfacial dynamics is at the core of each of these technologies and forms the backbone of the research conducted at UCLID.

<!---Hi! I'm an engineer by profession, researcher by curiosity and educator by passion. I'm currently an assistant professor in [Mechanical and Materials Engineering](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/mechanical-materials-engineering.html) at [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/). --->


<!---Background
------ 
Liquid-vapor phase change is ubiquitous in both natural and engineered devices. It’s happening around us – all the time. The cup of coffee, the tree outdoor, the AC unit indoor, they are all undergoing “evaporation” in some form. Curved surfaces (such as droplets and bubbles) exhibit unique properties due to surface tension that alters evaporation. In turn, the evaporation further deforms and moves the interface. At UCLID, we focus on liquid-vapor phase change and associated interfacial dynamics. We study multi-phase transport phenomena using a combination of visualization tools, theory, and modeling. We work on a variety of topics including but not limited to boiling, condensation, dehumidification, evaporative deposition, colloidal self-assembly, porous media transport, electronics cooling, cryogenics, variable-gravity fluid management, and nano-/micro-scale heat transfer.

<!--- Bio
------
I recieved a BS in Mechanical Engineering from [Milwaukee School of Engineering](https://www.msoe.edu/) in 2013. I then briefly worked as a hydraulics engineer at The Raymond Corp. in Greene, NY. It only took me a few months to realize grad school is where I belonged. I graduated with an MS in 2016 and a PhD in August 2018, both from [Michigan Technological University](https://www.mtu.edu/).

[]: Interests
------
My research is mainly focused on liquid-vapor phase change (evaporation/condensation) and associated interfacial phenomena. My specific interests include micro-scale thermophysics, capillary phenomena, heat and mass transfer, cryogenics, optical characterization, computational fluid dynamics, data driven modeling, scientific and high performance computing. In short, if theres a liquid-vapor mixture that's either small, cold or in space - I'm interested in it!

Although most of my work is computational in nature, my unique interests have led me to use / develop novel characterization tools (neutron imaging, interferometry, SANS, SPR microscopy and ellipsometry) to validate models and explore different aspects of my research intersts. I'm currently working on multiple projects on fundamental liquid-vapor phase change both on earth and on the International Space Station. Want to learn more? Explore the different tabs on this website or send me an <a href="mailto:bellurkn@ucmail.uc.edu">email</a>.

I would love to collaborate with anyone interested in any of the above topics. I'm also passionate about teaching emphasizing on "hands-on" active learning, data analysis and communication and integrated thermo-fluid-sciences. 

In my spare time, I like to sample new cuisines, test new recipes and explore the outdoors by any self propelled means possible - walk, bike, ski or run.
