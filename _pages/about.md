Hi! I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar in Mechanical Engineering - Engineering Mechanics at Michigan Technological University and a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

My research interests include micro-scale thermophysics, liquid-vapor phase change (evaporation/condensation), capillary phenomena, heat and mass transfer, cryogenics, material characterization, computational fluid dynamics and scientific computing. I'm currently working on multiple projects on fundamental liquid-vapor phase change both on earth and on the International Space Station. I would love to collaborate with anyone interested in any of the above topics. I'm also passionate about teaching emphasizing on "hands-on" active learning, data analysis and communication and integrated thermo-fluid-sciences.

I'm currently looking for a postdoc, research engineer, staff scientist or faculty position beginning August/September 2020.
