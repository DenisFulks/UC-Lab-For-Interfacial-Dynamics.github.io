We are happy to present our [latest publication](https://kishanbellur.github.io/publications/chakrabarti_2023.html) on analysis of the Constrained Vapor Bubble (CVB) experiment on the International Space Station (ISS). We used data from the NASA Physical Sciences Informatics (PSI) database combined with multi-scale liquid-vapor phase change modeling to argue against the common long standing assumption of an isothermal liquid-vapor interface. We show that the  non-isothermal interface results in strong Marangoni flow in the absence of gravity. The computational analysis reveals recirculating flow patterns and stagnation points that correlate extremely well with optical signatures from experiments.

This manuscript holds special place for us since it includes three academic generations!
