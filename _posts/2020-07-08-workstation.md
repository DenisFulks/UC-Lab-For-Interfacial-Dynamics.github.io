Like the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic meant that I had work from home full time. Initially, it didn't feel like much of a problem. Slowly but surely, productivity problems crept up. The biggest of these was that my 7 year old alienware 13 laptop running ubuntu 16.04 just didn't have the oomph to be my primary workstation. Remote access to MTU computing infrastructure proved erratic due to a bad internet connection and that 16.04 had deprecated security protocols. I jumped on the ubuntu 20.04 bandwagon and that solved the problem temporarily but at that point an idea was already firmly seated in my brain - it was time for a new computer. Talking to my partner made me realize that I didnt have to buy a prebuilt one, I could order in the parts and build one myself for much cheaper. Since this was going to sit at home, size/weight was not a factor. Here is my first workstation build journey.
