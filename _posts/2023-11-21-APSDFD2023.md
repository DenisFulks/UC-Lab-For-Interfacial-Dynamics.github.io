The 2023 Division of Fluid Dynamics Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society, held in Washington, DC, was a melting pot of innovative ideas and groundbreaking research. Our lab was thrilled to be a part of the event, where our student, Ayaaz Yasin, presented a talk on "[A Numerical Study of Coefficient-free Kinetic Evaporation Modeling in Liquid Hydrogen](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD23/Session/R36.8)" during Mutliphase Flows: Computational Methods session. 

Computational models of evaporation, especially in cryogenic propellants such as Hydrogen, typically use tuning-coefficients to get simulation results to match experimental results or to achieve numerical stability. Ayaaz presented his research aimed to solving this problem by developing a new physics-based evporation model and validating it against experimental results for Hydrogen. 

We are proud to annouce that Ayaaz's work received recognition from APS in the form a travel grant. The grant not only serves as a testament to Ayaaz's skills but also acknowledges the significance of the broader research objectives of our lab.
