Things I set up after a fresh ubuntu 20.04 installation. Tested on an old alienware 13 and implemented on a custom built workstation. Most of the software and settings I describe below are cross-platform, meaning these tools are available on the 3 major OS's : Linux, Windows and Mac. A bit a googling will point you in the right direction for any OS.

* [Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) is an open source fork of [synergy 1.9](https://symless.com/synergy). It allows you to share a single mouse/keyboard between multiple computers. It works similar to a the old KVM switches that used an dial or button to switch between computers. Barrier does this virtually over a wired or wireless network. You can simply move your move your mouse from one computer screen into the other seamlessly. Install from the software center using "sudo snap install barrier". Available on

* [MEGA](https://mega.nz/login) is my preferred cloud drive. Install the [megasync](https://mega.nz/sync) for desktop integration.

* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is my go-to citation manager for many reasons. Its simple, easy to use, customizable, open source and has a great browser plugin! Stephen Chignell has a great article on setting up [the best reference manager for research and writing](https://www.nrel.colostate.edu/set-up-best-reference-manager/) if you are interested.
  * Install both the standalone version and the connectior from [here](https://www.zotero.org/download/).
  * While zotero is great on its own, it dosent do everything but if you look around chances are you will find a plugin that does what you want. I like to rename the attached pdf files and move them to a custom location. Enter [zotfile](http://zotfile.com/).
  * Unhappy with zotero's builtin bib export? Use [better-bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/).
  * Make or log in to your zotero.org account. Set up sync. Who dosent want access to their virtual research stash from everywhere? Hint - its also a backup!
  * I sync pdf files through MEGA but bib entries through my zotero.org account. Thanks for the idea Stephen!
