Things I set up after a fresh ubuntu 20.04 installation. Tested on an old alienware 13 and implemented on a custom built workstation. Most of the software and settings I describe below are cross-platform, meaning these tools are available on the 3 major OS's : Linux, Windows and Mac. A bit a googling will point you in the right direction for any OS.

* [Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) is an open source fork of [synergy 1.9](https://symless.com/synergy). It allows you to share a single mouse/keyboard between multiple computers. It works similar to a the old KVM switches that used an dial or button to switch between computers. Barrier does this virtually over a wired or wireless network. You can simply move your move your mouse from one computer screen into the other seamlessly. Install from the software center using "sudo snap install barrier". Available on

* [MEGA](https://mega.nz/login) is my preferred cloud drive. Install the [megasync](https://mega.nz/sync) for desktop integration.

* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is my go-to citation manager for many reasons. Its simple, easy to use, customizable, open source and has a great browser plugin! Stephen Chignell has a great article on setting up [the best reference manager for research and writing](https://www.nrel.colostate.edu/set-up-best-reference-manager/) if you are interested.
  * Install both the standalone version and the connectior from [here](https://www.zotero.org/download/).
  * While zotero is great on its own, it dosent do everything but if you look around chances are you will find a plugin that does what you want. I like to rename the attached pdf files and move them to a custom location. Enter [zotfile](http://zotfile.com/).
  * Unhappy with zotero's builtin bib export? Use [better-bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/).
  * Make or log in to your zotero.org account. Set up sync. Who dosent want access to their virtual research stash from everywhere? Hint - its also a backup!
  * I sync pdf files through MEGA but bib entries through my zotero.org account. Thanks for the idea Stephen!

  * I sync and keep track of my my custom code and other personal projects (like this website) through [git](https://git-scm.com/)- a free open source revision control system, hosted on [github](https://github.com/). I have multiple github accounts (work and persoanl) and repositories (one for each project). Keeping track of multiple accounts and repositories can be messy. I found this useful article on creating custom hostnames that enables using multiple accounts from the same machine using different ssh keys. Read the article here or follow the steps
	
    * generate ssh keys, one key for each github account. Lets assume you make two keys - peronalKey and workKey. These are stored in ~/.ssh by default.
    * Create a file ~/.ssh/config and add the following
      Host gitlab.com
    	HostName gitlab.com
    	User git
    	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personalKey
      Host gitlab.com-work
    	HostName gitlab.com
    	User git
    	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/workKey
    * add the generated keys to the corresponding account on github.com
    * choose one account to be the primary and set up global settings for this account.
    * clone primary repository
    * clone other repos or change url if already cloned
    * Test!
  * I use latex almost exclusively for manuscript generation. Install [texlive](https://tug.org/texlive/).
  * I find gedit to be the best text editor on linux for almost everything, except when you are limited to just the terminal (in which case - vi). Gedit is good but the plug-ins make it great. Install plugins using the terminal "sudo apt install gedit-plugins". The embeded terminal is a must have to edit and compile tex files with ease.
  * Install vpn client(s) if necessary
  * Install [arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
  * Install [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for vector graphics editing. Almost all the graphics in my publications are made or edited or processed through inkscape.

Now you have a high productivity ubuntu installation customized for academia!
