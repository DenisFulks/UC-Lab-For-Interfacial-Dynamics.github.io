Presenting the new and improved UCLID website. While we have had a [formal UC website](https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/lab-for-interfacial-dynamics.html), it was time to revive my defunct personal website and transform it into a group website. Historically, I have refrained from "posting" anything on a public form. I've realized I need to overcome this and what better way than to put my students front-and-center and empower them to post updates while learning to use git effectively and maintain the site. As with a lot of things we do at UCLID, this is an experiment that will evolve with time and group interests but I hope that this becomes a productive (and fun) exercise that keeps the website more active.

Here's to UCLID 2.0!
