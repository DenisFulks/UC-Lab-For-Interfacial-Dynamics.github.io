In the spring semester of 2019, I taught a 4 credit junior level undergraduate course in thermo-fluids. This unique course focused on fundamentals and applications of fluid mechanics and heat transfer to fluid flow in ducts and pipes (internal flow). Concepts from fluid mechanics and heat transfer were taught simultaneously in an integrated thermal-fluids approach. Course topics included:

  * Introduction to fluids, fluid flow and Heat Transfer
	* Unit systems. 
	* Thermodynamic and transport properties of
momentum and heat transfer.
	* Fluid Statics, manometry and pressure.
  * Control Volume Analysis
	* Conservation laws - mass, momentum and energy.
	* Reynolds transport theorem
	* Bernoulli equation & applications
  * Steady State Conduction Heat Transfer
	* Boundary and initial conditions
	* Thermal resistance networks
	* Adding dimensions and changing coordinate systems
  * Dimensional Analysis
	* Buckingham Pi theorem
	* Scaling experimental data
  * Transient Heat Transfer
	* Lumped mass analysis & Biot number
  * Internal flow
	* Entrance length, fully-developed flow
	* Pressure and shear stress
	* Laminar pipe flow
	* Turbulent pipe flow (major and minor losses, moody diagram, loss coefficients)
	* Parallel pipe flow
  * Internal flow with convective heat transfer
	* Thermal and inertial entrance lengths, Re, Nu, Pr
	* Heat conduction in a stationary fluid
	* Newtons law of cooling
	* Constant heat flux condition
	* Constant wall temperature condition, log-mean-temperature
