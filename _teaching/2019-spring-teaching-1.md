In the spring semester of 2019, I taught MEEM 3201, a 4 credit junior level undergraduate course in thermo-fluids. This unique course combines aspects from fluid mechanics and heat transfer. The course is geared towards a comprehensive approach to model, analyze and design pipe/duct flow. Course topics included:

  * Introduction to fluids, fluid flow and Heat Transfer
      * Unit systems, 
      * Thermodynamic and transport properties of
momentum and heat transfer.
	*Fluid Statics, Manometry and Pressure
