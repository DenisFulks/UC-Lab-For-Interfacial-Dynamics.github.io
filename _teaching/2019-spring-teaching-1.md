In the spring semester of 2019, I taught MEEM 3201, a 4 credit junior level undergraduate course in thermo-fluids. This unique course combines aspects from fluid mechanics and heat transfer. The course is geared towards a comprehensive approach to model, analyze and design pipe/duct flow. Course topics included:

  * Introduction to fluids, fluid flow and Heat Transfer
	* Unit systems. 
	* Thermodynamic and transport properties of
momentum and heat transfer.
	* Fluid Statics, manometry and pressure.
  * Control Volume Analysis
	* Conservation laws - mass, momentum and energy.
	* Reynolds Transport Theorem
	* Bernoulli equation & Applications
  * Steady State Conduction Heat Transfer
	* Boundary and Initial Conditions
	* Thermal Resistance Networks
	* Adding dimensions and changing coordinate systems
  * Dimensional Analysis
	* Buckingham Pi Theorem
	* Scaling experimental data
  * Transient Heat Transfer
	* Lumped Mass Analysis & Biot number
  * Internal flow
	* Entrance length, fully-developed flow
	* Pressure and shear stress
	* Laminar pipe flow from dimensional analysis and conservation of energy
	* Turbulent pipe flow
          * major losses & Moody diagram
          * minor losses & loss coefficients
	* Parallel pipe flow
  * Internal flow with convective heat transfer
	* Thermal and inertial entrance lengths, Re, Nu, Pr
	* Heat conduction in a stationary fluid
	* Newtons law of cooling
	* Constant heat flux condition
	* Constant wall temperature condition, log-mean-temperature
