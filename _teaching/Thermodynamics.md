Prof. Bellur typically teaches MECH 2010: Thermodynamics every Fall semester. This is a second year, 4 credit, required undergraduate course in Mechanical Engineering. In this course, students will:
* learn about mass and energy balances for closed and open systems,
* develop an understanding of entropy, the second law of thermodynamics, and isentropic efficiencies of engineering devices,
* be able to use these concepts to analyze power and refrigeration cycles, and
* be able to apply principles of thermodynamics to formulate and solve engineering problems of interest.
The course is highly interactive with in-class activities, open-ended projects, weekly group presentations and a tour of the UC power plant.
