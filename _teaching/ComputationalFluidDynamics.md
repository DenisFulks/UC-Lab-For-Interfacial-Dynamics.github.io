Prof. Bellur typically teaches EGFD 5137/6037: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) every Spring semester. This is a cross-listed 3 credit course open to senior undergraduate and graduate students in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The objective of the course is to familiarize students with computational methods to solve thermal-fluid and heat transfer problems. Numerical solutions to 1D equations are implemented using finite difference and validated with analytical solutions. Various discretization techniques, implicit/explicit schemes, stability and error are discussed. Commercial software tools are introduced for 2D/3D applications. Future versions of the course will transition to open source architecture.
